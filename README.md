# sedna

The stack has been developed on top of the Robot Operating System (Indigo)  written in c++ and python.The segregation of work is based on nodes with each node responsible for handling tasks specific to that node. The main distinction of nodes are based on :

- Controllers
- Mission planners
- Device Drivers
- Simulator
- Teleop
- Odometry

All nodes in the package are fired up when the robot starts using a Roslaunch file. The mission planner is responsible for pushing directives to other nodes.
